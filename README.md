# AestheticVSR
The AestheticVSR is a VSR model to create high-quality videos.

## Overview
This work builds on diffusion models as the foundation for video generation and introduces a novel loss function that incorporates the aesthetic quality score from VBench to further enhance video quality.

AestheticVSR produces sharper edges and clearer details.  
The catâ€™s contours, fur, and the text "GOOD MORNING" are more distinct, while the background remains smooth.  
Difference analysis confirms that edges are enhanced without losing overall visual quality.

## Conclusion
AestheticVSR improves video generation by combining diffusion models with an aesthetic-based loss from VBench.  
It achieves clearer frames and better visual quality than existing methods, showing the potential of diffusion models for high-quality video generation.
